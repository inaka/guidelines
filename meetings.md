## Rules for conducting effective meetings

Here are some rules that should be followed in all meetings. If these
aren’t being followed you should be asking yourself whose time is being
wasted – yours and/or others’?

1.  Think about whether this really needs a meeting at all.

2.  Only invite those who need to be there.

3.  Regularly assess whether recurring meetings are needed at all or
    whether they’re needed with that frequency.

4.  Each meeting should have an agenda. This need not be complex (it
    could all be contained in the calendar invite itself) but should
    identify:

    a.  The time, date and place of the meeting. If it has remote
        participants, it should contain clear instructions for them to
        join, so time isn’t wasted discussing whether it be by phone,
        Skype, GoTo Meeting etc

    b.  The length of the meeting – only as long as necessary (meetings
        have a habit of expanding to fill the allocated time!)

    c.  The purpose/objectives of the meeting (it’s sometimes useful in
        working out the purpose of a proposed meeting to ask this in
        reverse – i.e. ‘what would happen if the meeting didn’t
        take place?’)

    d.  The participants and their roles – particularly the ‘chair’, who
        should lead the meeting. It is his/her responsibility to ensure
        that the meeting is conducted in accordance with these rules

    e.  Time limits for each topic

    f.  What is expected from each participant (e.g. what preparation is
        each person expected to have done before the meeting; what
        specific contribution is expected from them in the meeting)

    g.  Who is responsible for making and distributing a record of the
        meeting (if one is needed) and its agreed actions

5.  If people are expected to have read documents etc beforehand, these
    should be circulated sufficiently in advance to enable this to have
    been done.

6.  It is your responsibility to have prepared for your part in the
    meeting – this means being on time, prepared and being able to
    participate for the duration of the meeting.

7.  During the meeting:

    a.  No phones at all – certainly not visible on tables and
        preferably not present, even on silent/vibrate – you can live
        without that dopamine rush for the meeting duration!

    b.  No laptops except if needed for the agenda (but not to check on
        emails, message people etc);

    c.  No side conversations – one person to speak at a time;

    d.  Minimise interruptions;

    e.  When you’re not speaking do others the courtesy of listening to
        what they have to say (even if you think you already know it)

    f.  Agree actions that are ‘owned’ by one person each and are SMART
        (Specific; Measurable; Agreed upon; Realistic (or Reasonable,
        Relevant, Results-orientated) and Time-based

    g.  If discussions go ‘off topic’, stop the digression and agree to
        take that discussion outside the meeting – it’s unlikely to be
        of relevance/interest to the others in the meeting.

8.  Thank people for their participation and, if there needs to be a
    follow up meeting, agree its time, place etc before the
    meeting ends.
